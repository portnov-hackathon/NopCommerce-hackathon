# NopCommerce-hackathon

This project automates basic search and addition of product to shopping cart and product review functionality.

It consists of two feature files, one feature file consists of scenarios for guest user and other feature file consist of scenarios for Registered user.

There is issue with core functionality which is a registered user is unable to proceed with checkout and place order through web application. Thus, limited the steps till checkout page.
